# Ellas vs Maxims

Welcome to Ellas vs Maxims, a parody of Plants vs Zombies.

Developer Guide
---------------

- If you are adding minor changes, please do not commit until the feature is complete and the code compiles.

- If adding major changes, please create a separate branch to avoid merge conflicts.

- Stick to the coding style used so far (tabs, curly braces on same line as if/for/while loops etc.)

- Keep different classes to different files (keep everything in the src directory)
